    looking for work within the industry. Why look for employment when we have started our
    business, which we hold so dear? We want to work hard in our respective fields so that we
    ensure that Expansion never has to go anywhere, even if we are not taking on further work at
    any point.`,

    achievements. We hope you find our website a refreshing example of like minded individuals
    coming together to help expand each other further in the design and development fields.`,
